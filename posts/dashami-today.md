Today is a sad day. It is the day when maa Durga returns back to Kailash from the mortal land. We, Bengalis bid a farewell to the holy mother and pray she comes back to this land of humans with all her glories, majesty, and blessings next year again. We hope we pray, we hug each other on this day to remind ourselves that nothing is permanent in this world. A journey that starts, comes to an end. Our life revolves around so much chaos during this short-haul, a journey called life. But eventually, we all come to an end. Our physical existence melts down back to the water on this earth. The last whole week was wonderful for people in this place called Kolkata. The riches and the poor, all have enjoyed their own way during the presence of our Mother God. But, it is time to say goodbye to her.

  

The Hindu religion base its root on a deep scientific understanding and practices of Hindu Rishis(saint, sage), going back in time for a massive 4000 years. The Hindu saints, extremely knowledgeable, ingrained their wisdom into the religion, wrapped inside stories, which from outside was quite relatable and easy to follow by the general mass. The appeal towards Hinduism is in its simplicity of the basis of the religion. Physical laws of mathematics and logic are at every layer in this religion. In its long history, the Hindu religion has been reformed a number of times but the primary essence of its simplicity still attracts thousands of Hindus, the way it was meant to be thousands of years ago. In this twenty-first century, where the world has gone ahead trying to reach for the star, we still strongly believe today, on this very specific day, mother Durga, after spending 10 days in this mortal world starts her return journey to an ethereal place somewhere on the high lands of Himalaya only to come back again next year.
